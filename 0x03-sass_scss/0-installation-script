Steps to Install SASS
Ensure Node.js and npm are installed

Check if Node.js is installed:

bash
node -v
Check if npm is installed:

bash
npm -v
If not installed, download Node.js (which includes npm) from https://nodejs.org.

Install SASS (version 3.7.4) globally
Run the following command:

bash
npm install -g sass@3.7.4
-g installs it globally (available system-wide).

@3.7.4 ensures version 3.7.4 is installed.

Verify Installation
Check if SASS was installed correctly:

bash
sass --version
Expected output:

1.14.4 compiled with dart2js 2.14.4
(Note: The version may show 1.14.4 because 3.7.4 refers to the npm package version, not the Dart Sass compiler version.)
